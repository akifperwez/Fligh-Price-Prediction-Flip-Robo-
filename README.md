Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted.
